## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, saturated purple (#A06CD5) to convey a sense of digital sophistication and mystique, aligning with the theme of cybersecurity and advanced tech.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated purple (#F0E8F5) to provide a soft, clean backdrop that allows the primary and accent colors to pop.
- Accent color: A muted teal (#62B1BD), analogous to purple but distinct enough in brightness and saturation to draw attention to interactive elements and important information.
- System monospace font for code snippets and terminal sections.
- Use of a playful, cartoon-style font like 'Fredoka One' for titles.
- Line art, cartoon-style icons for site navigation and project categories.
- A non-linear, card-based layout with elements arranged in a 'graphic designer's mood board' style.
- Subtle hover effects with animations like jiggling elements, 'beeping' sounds, or pixel glows.
