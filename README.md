## 🌿 Git Workflow (DevOps Task Focus)

- `main` – production-ready branch  
- `dev` – active development branch  
- `feature/initial-setup` – temporary feature branch used during initial setup

---

## ✅ Git Highlights

- Used `git init` to start the repo
- Created branches: `main`, `dev`, `feature/initial-setup`
- Made commits to both `feature` and `dev` branches
- Opened pull requests: `feature → dev`, then `dev → main`
- Merged via PRs using GitHub UI
- Used `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Added Git tag `v1.0` to mark the first stable release
- Created markdown log of steps (`TASK_LOG.md`)

## 🏷 Version

**v1.0** – First stable release
